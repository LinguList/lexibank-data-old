## Changes in the transcription system 

The transcription system required some changes. Some letters were wrongly chosen from IPA standards, and I decided to count all spaces as indicators of morpheme boundaries, thus adding a "+" character, rather than representing them as two words. This only applies to the segmented transcription and alignments, as the original data has been preserved.
