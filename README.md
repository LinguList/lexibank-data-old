# lexibank-data

lexibank-data is a repository intended to bring together (wordlist-like) data and tools in the field of Historical Linguistics.
It aims at providing unified access to data published in various places and ways via
- a unified dataset manipulation workflow,
- a common data format based on [CLDF](http://cldf.clld.org),
- a set of data quality metrics, assessing the interoperability of datasets.

- **Concepticon:** To make datasets comparable we need a mapping (aka [schema crosswalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_crosswalk)) between the concept lists (aka [Swadesh lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list)) used in each dataset. Fortunately, this has already been done for many concept lists by the [CLLD Concepticon](http://concepticon.clld.org). `lexibank` uses Concepticon [concept sets](http://concepticon.clld.org/parameters) to identify concepts across datasets.
